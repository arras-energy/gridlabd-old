%description
GridLAB-D™ is a power distribution system simulation and analysis tool
that provides information to users who design and operate modern
distribution systems, and to utilities that wish to take advantage of the
latest energy technologies. It incorporates advanced modeling
techniques with high-performance algorithms to deliver high resolution end-use
modeling in moder power systems. GridLAB-D is coupled with distribution 
automation models and software integration tools for users of many power 
system analysis tools.

GridLAB-D was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), in collaboration with industry and
academia.

This version of GridLAB-D was enhanced at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory
by the California Energy Commission under grants EPC-17-043, EPC-17-046, and EPC-17-047.
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, which is operated for the US Department of Energy 
by Stanford University under Contract DE-AC02-76SF00515.

	<H2>Installing HiPAS GridLAB-D</H2>

	<B>IMPORTANT:</B> This installer is designed to install HiPAS GridLAB-D on a new system image such as <CODE>wsl</CODE>, <CODE>ec2</CODE>, or <CODE>docker</CODE>.  Do not use this on an existing system unless you are ok with significant changes to your system's build tools.

	<P/>

	To install HiPAS GridLAB-D on your Linux or Mac system, type the following commands at a shell prompt:

	<P/>

	<CODE>
		bash$ curl -sL http://install.gridlabd.us/install.sh | sh
	</CODE>

	If your system is not supported by this installer, please use the manual installation method provided with the <A HREF="https://source.gridlabd.us/">HiPAS GridLAB-D source code</A>.

	<H2>Validating HiPAS GridLAB-D</H2>

	To validate your HiPAS GridLAB-D installation on your Linux or Mac system, type the following command at a shell prompt:

	<P/>

	<CODE>
		bash$ git clone https://source.gridlabd.us/ gridlabd
		bash$ gridlabd -W gridlabd --validate
	</CODE>

	<P/>

	The validation process takes around 10 minutes.

	The result will be placed in a folder called <CODE>validate.txt</CODE>.  Errors will be reported as it goes. To inspect an error, find the output files in the folder of the same name as the GLM file, i.e., <CODE>gridlabd/PATH/autotest/FILE.glm</CODE> will place output files in <CODE>gridlabd/PATH/autotest/FILE</CODE>

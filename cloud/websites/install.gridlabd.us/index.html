	<B>IMPORTANT:</B> This installer is designed to install HiPAS GridLAB-D on a new system image such as <CODE>wls</CODE>, <CODE>ec2</CODE>, or <CODE>docker</CODE>.  Do not use this on an existing system unless you are ok with significant changes to your system's python infrastructure and system build tools.

	<P/>

	To install HiPAS GridLAB-D on your Linux or Mac system, type the following command at a shell prompt:

	<P/>

	<CODE>
		bash$ curl -sL http://install.gridlabd.us/install.sh | sudo /bin/bash

	<H2>Validating HiPAS GridLAB-D</H2>

	To validate your HiPAS GridLAB-D installation on your Linux or Mac system, type the following command at a shell prompt:

### These code snippets are really handy commands that are surprisingly difficult to find.
### Hopefully they can be helpful for future maintainers.



### For connections to a virtual machine (I used parallels) where you cannot easily transfer the packaged tar file
### back to your local system. (Parallel Tools couldn't always be installed unfortunately)

scp remoteuser@remoteserver:/remote/folder/remotefile.txt  localfile.txt

### The above official syntax is a little deceptive, and makes you manually rename the file. 
### The below SCP example is the one I use and preserves the original filename.
### Since I use automated naming for standardization and proper version tracking, the below example is generally better.

scp a123456@macOS.local:/Users/a123456/temp/*  $HOME/temp

### The below command is useful for copying an image built in docker to the host for upload and whatnot

docker cp <containerId>:/file/path/within/container /host/path/target

### Example to copy all files from folder into home directory

docker cp c7e8c527dcb2b9caf189a18ea56886014f8c3cfe08d05339058a797d7278b546:/root/temp/. $HOME

### Python modules should start without a hashbang, and instead use the below code without the #s. 
### This essentially makes the file swap dynamically to the calling gridlabd version's python3, and
### doesn't create a loop or syntax issues, allowing the file to operate like a proper python file.
### See gridlabd-convert as an example. 

''':'
exec "$GLD_BIN/python3" "$0" "$@"
:' '''

### Some good variables to know:

### This is a variable created when compiled, and is intrinsic to the specific gridlabd version calling the files.
### It points to the version's specific bin directory, which is really handy for dynamically calling internal bin files. 
$GLD_BIN

### This is a makefile specific variable that exists for the build. It has the same directory as GLD_BIN
$bindir

### This is a magic autotools variable. It is similar to GLD_BIN and bindir, but is used in the m4 family of files.
### It points to the top of the version directory, right above bin.

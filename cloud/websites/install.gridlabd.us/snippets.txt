### Python modules should start without a hashbang, and instead use the below code without the #s. 
### This essentially makes the file swap dynamically to the calling gridlabd version's python3, and
### doesn't create a loop or syntax issues, allowing the file to operate like a proper python file.
### See gridlabd-convert as an example. 

''':'
exec "$GLD_BIN/python3" "$0" "$@"
:' '''

### Some good variables to know:

### This is a variable created when compiled, and is intrinsic to the specific gridlabd version calling the files.
### It points to the version's specific bin directory, which is really handy for dynamically calling internal bin files. 
$GLD_BIN

### This is a makefile specific variable that exists for the build. It has the same directory as GLD_BIN
$bindir

### This is a magic autotools variable. It is similar to GLD_BIN and bindir, but is used in the m4 family of files.
### It points to the top of the version directory, right above bin.

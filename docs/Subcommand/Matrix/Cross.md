[[/Cross]]

Syntax
------

matrix cross <matrix> <matrix> axisa=<int> axisb=<int> axisc=<int> axis=<int>


    Return the cross product of two (arrays of) vectors.

    The cross product of `a` and `b` in :math:`R^3` is a vector perpendicular
    to both `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are arrays of vectors, the vectors
    are defined by the last axis of `a` and `b` by default, and these axes
    can have dimensions 2 or 3.  Where the dimension of either `a` or `b` is
    2, the third component of the input vector is assumed to be zero and the
    cross product calculated accordingly.  In cases where both input vectors
    have dimension 2, the z-component of the cross product is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Components of the first vector(s).
    b : array_like
        Components of the second vector(s).
    axisa : int, optional
        Axis of `a` that defines the vector(s).  By default, the last axis.
    axisb : int, optional
        Axis of `b` that defines the vector(s).  By default, the last axis.
    axisc : int, optional
        Axis of `c` containing the cross product vector(s).  Ignored if
        both input vectors have dimension 2, as the return is scalar.
        By default, the last axis.
    axis : int, optional
        If defined, the axis of `a`, `b` and `c` that defines the vector(s)
        and cross product(s).  Overrides `axisa`, `axisb` and `axisc`.

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        Vector cross product(s).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When the dimension of the vector(s) in `a` and/or `b` does not
        equal 2 or 3.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Supports full broadcasting of the inputs.

    Examples
    --------
    Vector cross-product.

    >>> x = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> y = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> np.cross(x, y)
    array([-3,  6, -3])

    One vector with dimension 2.

    >>> x = [1, 2]
    >>> y = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> np.cross(x, y)
    array([12, -6, -3])

    Equivalently:

    >>> x = [1, 2, 0]
    >>> y = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> np.cross(x, y)
    array([12, -6, -3])

    Both vectors with dimension 2.

    >>> x = [1,2]
    >>> y = [4,5]
    >>> np.cross(x, y)
    array(-3)

    Multiple vector cross-products. Note that the direction of the cross
    product vector is defined by the `right-hand rule`.

    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> y = np.array([[4,5,6], [1,2,3]])
    >>> np.cross(x, y)
    array([[-3,  6, -3],
           [ 3, -6,  3]])

    The orientation of `c` can be changed using the `axisc` keyword.

    >>> np.cross(x, y, axisc=0)
    array([[-3,  3],
           [ 6, -6],
           [-3,  3]])

    Change the vector definition of `x` and `y` using `axisa` and `axisb`.

    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> y = np.array([[7, 8, 9], [4,5,6], [1,2,3]])
    >>> np.cross(x, y)
    array([[ -6,  12,  -6],
           [  0,   0,   0],
           [  6, -12,   6]])
    >>> np.cross(x, y, axisa=0, axisb=0)
    array([[-24,  48, -24],
           [-30,  60, -30],
           [-36,  72, -36]])

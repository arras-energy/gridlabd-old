[[/Diff]]

~~~
Syntax
------

matrix diff <matrix> n=<int> axis=<int> prepend=<matrix> append=<matrix>


    Calculate the n-th discrete difference along the given axis.

    The first difference is given by ``out[i] = a[i+1] - a[i]`` along
    the given axis, higher differences are calculated by using `diff`
    recursively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array
    n : int, optional
        The number of times values are differenced. If zero, the input
        is returned as-is.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which the difference is taken, default is the
        last axis.
    prepend, append : array_like, optional
        Values to prepend or append to `a` along axis prior to
        performing the difference.  Scalar values are expanded to
        arrays with length 1 in the direction of axis and the shape
        of the input array in along all other axes.  Otherwise the
        dimension and shape must match `a` except along axis.

    Returns
    -------
    diff : ndarray
        The n-th differences. The shape of the output is the same as `a`
        except along `axis` where the dimension is smaller by `n`. The
        type of the output is the same as the type of the difference
        between any two elements of `a`. This is the same as the type of
        `a` in most cases. A notable exception is `datetime64`, which
        results in a `timedelta64` output array.

    Notes
    -----
    Type is preserved for boolean arrays, so the result will contain
    `False` when consecutive elements are the same and `True` when they
    differ.

    For unsigned integer arrays, the results will also be unsigned. This
    should not be surprising, as the result is consistent with
    calculating the difference directly:

    >>> u8_arr = np.array([1, 0], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.diff(u8_arr)
    array([255], dtype=uint8)
    >>> u8_arr[1,...] - u8_arr[0,...]
    255

    If this is not desirable, then the array should be cast to a larger
    integer type first:

    >>> i16_arr = u8_arr.astype(np.int16)
    >>> np.diff(i16_arr)
    array([-1], dtype=int16)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 4, 7, 0])
    >>> np.diff(x)
    array([ 1,  2,  3, -7])
    >>> np.diff(x, n=2)
    array([  1,   1, -10])

    >>> x = np.array([[1, 3, 6, 10], [0, 5, 6, 8]])
    >>> np.diff(x)
    array([[2, 3, 4],
           [5, 1, 2]])
    >>> np.diff(x, axis=0)
    array([[-1,  2,  0, -2]])

    >>> x = np.arange('1066-10-13', '1066-10-16', dtype=np.datetime64)
    >>> np.diff(x)
    array([1, 1], dtype='timedelta64[D]')

[[/I0]]

~~~
Syntax
------

matrix i0 <array>


    Modified Bessel function of the first kind, order 0.

    Usually denoted :math:`I_0`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like of float
        Argument of the Bessel function.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray, shape = x.shape, dtype = float
        The modified Bessel function evaluated at each of the elements of `x`.

    See Also
    --------
    scipy.special.i0, scipy.special.iv, scipy.special.ive

    Notes
    -----
    The scipy implementation is recommended over this function: it is a
    proper ufunc written in C, and more than an order of magnitude faster.

    We use the algorithm published by Clenshaw [1]_ and referenced by
    Abramowitz and Stegun [2]_, for which the function domain is
    partitioned into the two intervals [0,8] and (8,inf), and Chebyshev
    polynomial expansions are employed in each interval. Relative error on
    the domain [0,30] using IEEE arithmetic is documented [3]_ as having a
    peak of 5.8e-16 with an rms of 1.4e-16 (n = 30000).

[[/Matrix/Diagonal]]

~~~
Syntax
------

matrix diagonal <matrix>

a.diagonal(offset=0, axis1=0, axis2=1)

    Return specified diagonals. In NumPy 1.9 the returned array is a
    read-only view instead of a copy as in previous NumPy versions.  In
    a future version the read-only restriction will be removed.

    Refer to :func:`numpy.diagonal` for full documentation.

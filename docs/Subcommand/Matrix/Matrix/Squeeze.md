[[/Matrix/Squeeze]]

~~~
Syntax
------

matrix squeeze <matrix> axis=<int>


        Return a possibly reshaped matrix.

        Refer to `numpy.squeeze` for more documentation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
            Selects a subset of the axes of length one in the shape.
            If an axis is selected with shape entry greater than one,
            an error is raised.

        Returns
        -------
        squeezed : matrix
            The matrix, but as a (1, N) matrix if it had shape (N, 1).

        See Also
        --------
        numpy.squeeze : related function

        Notes
        -----
        If `m` has a single column then that column is returned
        as the single row of a matrix.  Otherwise `m` is returned.
        The returned matrix is always either `m` itself or a view into `m`.
        Supplying an axis keyword argument will not affect the returned matrix
        but it may cause an error to be raised.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> c = np.matrix([[1], [2]])
        >>> c
        matrix([[1],
                [2]])
        >>> c.squeeze()
        matrix([[1, 2]])
        >>> r = c.T
        >>> r
        matrix([[1, 2]])
        >>> r.squeeze()
        matrix([[1, 2]])
        >>> m = np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        >>> m.squeeze()
        matrix([[1, 2],
                [3, 4]])

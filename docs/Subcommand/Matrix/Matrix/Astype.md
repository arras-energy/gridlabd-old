Syntax
------

matrix astype <matrix> <str> order=<str> casting=<str> subok=<boolstr>

a.astype(dtype, order='K', casting='unsafe', subok=True, copy=True)

    Copy of the array, cast to a specified type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : str or dtype
        Typecode or data-type to which the array is cast.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        Controls the memory layout order of the result.
        'C' means C order, 'F' means Fortran order, 'A'
        means 'F' order if all the arrays are Fortran contiguous,
        'C' order otherwise, and 'K' means as close to the
        order the array elements appear in memory as possible.
        Default is 'K'.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur. Defaults to 'unsafe'
        for backwards compatibility.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.
    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through (default), otherwise
        the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array.
    copy : bool, optional
        By default, astype always returns a newly allocated array. If this
        is set to false, and the `dtype`, `order`, and `subok`
        requirements are satisfied, the input array is returned instead
        of a copy.

    Returns
    -------
    arr_t : ndarray
        Unless `copy` is False and the other conditions for returning the input
        array are satisfied (see description for `copy` input parameter), `arr_t`
        is a new array of the same shape as the input array, with dtype, order
        given by `dtype`, `order`.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionchanged:: 1.17.0
       Casting between a simple data type and a structured one is possible only
       for "unsafe" casting.  Casting to multiple fields is allowed, but
       casting from multiple fields is not.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.9.0
       Casting from numeric to string types in 'safe' casting mode requires
       that the string dtype length is long enough to store the max
       integer/float value converted.

    Raises
    ------
    ComplexWarning
        When casting from complex to float or int. To avoid this,
        one should use ``a.real.astype(t)``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 2.5])
    >>> x
    array([1. ,  2. ,  2.5])

    >>> x.astype(int)

[[/Matrix/Ravel]]

~~~
Syntax
------

matrix ravel <matrix> order=<str>


        Return a flattened matrix.

        Refer to `numpy.ravel` for more documentation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
            The elements of `m` are read using this index order. 'C' means to
            index the elements in C-like order, with the last axis index
            changing fastest, back to the first axis index changing slowest.
            'F' means to index the elements in Fortran-like index order, with
            the first index changing fastest, and the last index changing
            slowest. Note that the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the
            memory layout of the underlying array, and only refer to the order
            of axis indexing.  'A' means to read the elements in Fortran-like
            index order if `m` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory, C-like order
            otherwise.  'K' means to read the elements in the order they occur
            in memory, except for reversing the data when strides are negative.
            By default, 'C' index order is used.

        Returns
        -------
        ret : matrix
            Return the matrix flattened to shape `(1, N)` where `N`
            is the number of elements in the original matrix.
            A copy is made only if necessary.

        See Also
        --------
        matrix.flatten : returns a similar output matrix but always a copy
        matrix.flat : a flat iterator on the array.
        numpy.ravel : related function which returns an ndarray

[[/Cumsum]]

~~~
Syntax
------

matrix cumsum <matrix> axis=<int> [dtype=<str>]


    Return the cumulative sum of the elements along a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default
        (None) is to compute the cumsum over the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults
        to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with a
        precision less than that of the default platform integer.  In
        that case, the default platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type will be cast if necessary. See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for
        more details.

    Returns
    -------
    cumsum_along_axis : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case a reference to `out` is returned. The
        result has the same size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if
        `axis` is not None or `a` is a 1-d array.

    See Also
    --------
    sum : Sum array elements.
    trapz : Integration of array values using the composite trapezoidal rule.
    diff : Calculate the n-th discrete difference along given axis.

    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is
    raised on overflow.

    ``cumsum(a)[-1]`` may not be equal to ``sum(a)`` for floating-point
    values since ``sum`` may use a pairwise summation routine, reducing
    the roundoff-error. See `sum` for more information.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.cumsum(a)
    array([ 1,  3,  6, 10, 15, 21])
    >>> np.cumsum(a, dtype=float)     # specifies type of output value(s)
    array([  1.,   3.,   6.,  10.,  15.,  21.])

    >>> np.cumsum(a,axis=0)      # sum over rows for each of the 3 columns
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [5, 7, 9]])
    >>> np.cumsum(a,axis=1)      # sum over columns for each of the 2 rows
    array([[ 1,  3,  6],
           [ 4,  9, 15]])

    ``cumsum(b)[-1]`` may not be equal to ``sum(b)``

    >>> b = np.array([1, 2e-9, 3e-9] * 1000000)
    >>> b.cumsum()[-1]
    1000000.0050045159
    >>> b.sum()                    
    1000000.0050000029

[[/Arange]]

~~~
Syntax
------

matrix arange <float> <float> step=<float>

arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None)

    Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.

    Values are generated within the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``
    (in other words, the interval including `start` but excluding `stop`).
    For integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in
    `range` function, but returns an ndarray rather than a list.

    When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, the results will often not
    be consistent.  It is better to use `numpy.linspace` for these cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : number, optional
        Start of interval.  The interval includes this value.  The default
        start value is 0.
    stop : number
        End of interval.  The interval does not include this value, except
        in some cases where `step` is not an integer and floating point
        round-off affects the length of `out`.
    step : number, optional
        Spacing between values.  For any output `out`, this is the distance
        between two adjacent values, ``out[i+1] - out[i]``.  The default
        step size is 1.  If `step` is specified as a position argument,
        `start` must also be given.
    dtype : dtype
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
        type from the other input arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    arange : ndarray
        Array of evenly spaced values.

        For floating point arguments, the length of the result is
        ``ceil((stop - start)/step)``.  Because of floating point overflow,
        this rule may result in the last element of `out` being greater
        than `stop`.

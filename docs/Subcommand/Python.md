[[Subcommand/Python]] - subcommand to run Python in a GridLAB-D environment

# Synopsis
Shell:
~~~
  bash$ gridlabd python <options> ...
~~~

# Description

Normally GridLAB-D requires certain environment variables to be set to function properly.  If you are running Python code, and would like to use the GridLAB-D module, you can run Python inside that GridLAB-D environment using the `python` subcommand, where `<options>` are the Python command options

# Caveat

Only `python3` is supported, and the executable must be located at `/usr/local/bin/python3`.

# Example
~~~
  bash$ gridlabd python

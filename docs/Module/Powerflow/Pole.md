# Description

The pole object models poles in powerflow network. The current pole object models pole failure by overstress at the base the pole from wind pressure on the equipment, wire, and tilt.  The model does not model failures from ice loading on the lines or from foundation failure.

Generally, any link object in a powerflow model can be mounted on a pole by creating a `pole_mount` object that uses the pole as a parent, and providing just the `weather` and `pole_configuration` object references to the pole. The `pole_mount` object specifies the position, size, and weight of the equipment on the pole to model the effect of wind give the aerodynamic cross-section.

# Model

The pole failure model is described in [Pole Loading Model](https://github.com/slacgismo/gridlabd/raw/master/module/powerflow/docs/pole_loading.pdf).

The pole reaches end of life status based on a degradation rate that is defined by minimum shell thickness of 2". See [Pole Degradation Model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167473005000457) details.

# Description

The pole object models poles at nodes. The current pole object models pole failure by overstress failure at the base the pole from wind pressure on the equipment, wire, and tilt.  The model does not model failures from ice loading on the lines or from foundation failure.

Generally, any node in a powerflow model can be upgraded to a pole by providing just the `weather` and `pole_configuration` object references. 

Specifying `equipment_area` and `equipment_height` will cause the equipment wind load to be computed.

## Properties

~~~
  double tilt_angle[deg];
~~~

### `tilt_direction`
~~~
  double tilt_direction[deg];
~~~

The tilt direction of the pole.

### `weather`
~~~
  object weather;
~~~

Reference to the source of the weather data.

### `configuration`
~~~
  object configuration;
~~~

Reference to the pole configuration.

### `equipment_area`
~~~
  double equipment_area[sf];
~~~

Cross sectional area of the equipment.

### `equipment_height`
~~~
  double equipment_height[ft];
~~~

### `install_year`
~~~
  int32 install_year;
~~~

Year the pole was installed.

### `repair_time`
~~~
  double repair_time[h];
~~~

Time required to repair or replace the pole after failure.

### `pole_stress`
~~~
  double pole_stress[pu]; 
~~~

Ratio of actual stress to critical stress.

~~~

Constant c of the pole stress polynomial function.

### `susceptibility`
~~~
  double susceptibility[pu*s/m]; 
~~~

Susceptibility of pole to wind stress (derivative of pole stress w.r.t wind speed).

### `total_moment`
~~~
  double total_moment[ft*lb];
~~~

The total moment on the pole.

### `resisting_moment`
~~~
  double resisting_moment[ft*lb];

  double critical_wind_speed[m/s];
~~~

Wind speed at pole failure.

# Model

The pole failure model is described in [Pole Loading Model](https://github.com/dchassin/gridlabd/raw/master/powerflow/docs/pole_loading.pdf). 

The pole reaches end of life status based on a degradation rate that is defined by minimum shell thickness of 2". See [Pole Degradation Model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167473005000457) details.

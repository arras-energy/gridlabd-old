# Description

The pole object models poles in powerflow network. The current pole object models pole failure by overstress at the base the pole from wind pressure on the equipment, wire, and tilt. Ice on the line is modeled as an increase in the conductor diameter for respect to wind loading. The added weight is calculated assuming a cylindrically symmetric ice accumulation with constant density. The model does not model foundation failure.

Generally, any link object in a powerflow model can be mounted on a pole by creating a `pole_mount` object that uses the pole as a parent, and providing just the `weather` and `pole_configuration` object references to the pole. The `pole_mount` object specifies the position, size, and weight of the equipment on the pole to model the effect of wind give the aerodynamic cross-section.

## Properties

### `pole_status`

~~~
    enumeration {FAILED=0,OK=1} pole_status;
~~~

The status of the pole.

### `tilt_degree`

~~~
    double tilt_degree[deg];
~~~

The tilt angle of the pole.

### `tilt_direction`

~~~
    double tilt_direction[deg];
~~~

The tilt direction of the pole.

### `weather`

~~~
    object weather;
~~~

Reference to the source of the weather data.

### `configuration`

~~~
    object configuration;
~~~

Reference to the pole configuration.

### `install_year`

~~~
    int32 install_year;
~~~

Year the pole was installed.

### `repair_time`

~~~
    double repair_time[h];
~~~

Time required to repair or replace the pole after failure. Includes time to identify the failure and reach the site.

### `wind_speed`

~~~
    int32 wind_speed [m/s];
~~~

The wind speed at the location of the pole.  This is automatically set is the
`weather` object is provided.

### `wind_direction`

~~~
    int32 wind_direction [deg];
~~~

The wind direction at the location of the pole.  This is automatically set is the
`weather` object is provided.

### `wind_gusts`

~~~
    int32 wind_gusts [m/s];
~~~

The wind gusts at the location of the pole.  This is automatically set is the
`weather` object is provided.

### `pole_stress`

~~~
    double pole_stress[pu];
~~~

Ratio of actual (applied) moment to resisting moment (highest the pole can handle). When this reaches 1.0 or higher, the pole failes.

### `pole_stress_polynomial_a`

~~~
    double pole_stress_polynomial_a[ft*lb];
~~~

Constant a of the pole stress polynomial function.

### `pole_stress_polynomial_b`

~~~
    double pole_stress_polynomial_b[ft*lb];
~~~

Constant b of the pole stress polynomial function

### `pole_stress_polynomial_c`

~~~
    double pole_stress_polynomial_c[ft*lb];
~~~

Constant c of the pole stress polynomial function.

### `susceptibility`

~~~
    double susceptibility[pu*s/m];
~~~

Susceptibility of pole to wind stress (derivative of pole stress with respect to wind speed).

### `total_moment`

~~~
    double total_moment[ft*lb];
~~~

The total moment on the pole. This results from wind loads, gravitational loads, and potentially a transverse (perpendicular to the wires) load due to an angle in the conductors. There is wind pressure on the pole itself, the conductors attached to the pole, and the equipment mounted on the pole. Wind on equipment is usually much less signinficant than wind on the conductors. There are also gravitaional loads based on the pole tilt, it's weight and that of the mounted equipment and lines.


### `resisting_moment`

~~~
    double resisting_moment[ft*lb];
~~~

Maximum moment the pole can withstand before snapping. This is calculated based on the fiber strength of the wood species and the pole diameter where it is supported - either at ground line or where guy wire(s) are attached.

### `pole_moment`

~~~
    double pole_moment[ft*lb];
~~~

Moment on the pole due to it's own weight and tilt.

### `pole_moment_per_wind`

~~~
    double pole_moment_per_wind[ft*lb];
~~~

 The components of the equation for moment due to wind on the pole, except for wind pressure, i.e. moment per unit wind pressure. Accounts for the pole's cross-sectional area (for calculating the force of wind on the pole) and height (torque raduis).

### `equipment_moment`

~~~
    double equipment_moment[ft*lb];
~~~

Moments on the pole due to gravitational load (equipment weight, pole tilt) and wind load (based on cross-sectional area of equipment). 

### `equipment_moment_per_wind`

~~~
    double equipment_moment_per_wind[ft*lb];
~~~

 The components of the equation for moment due to wind on equipment, all except the wind pressure, i.e. moment per unit wind pressure.

### `critical_wind_speed`

~~~
    double critical_wind_speed[m/s];
~~~

Wind speed at pole failure.

### `wire_moment`

~~~
    double wire_moment[ft*lb];
~~~

Moments due to line tension, weight, and wind on the lines.

### `wire_tension`

~~~
    double wire_tension[ft*lb];
~~~

Wire moment due to conductor tension.

### `guy_height`

~~~
    double guy_height[m/s];
~~~

Guy wire attachment height.

# Model

The pole failure model is described in [Pole Loading Model](https://source.gridlabd.us/raw/master/module/powerflow/docs/pole_loading.pdf).

[Out of date, change this:] The pole reaches end of life status based on a degradation rate that is defined by minimum shell thickness of 2". See [Pole Degradation Model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167473005000457) details.

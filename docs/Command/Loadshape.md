[[/Command/Loadshape]] -- Generate loadshape from schedules used by model

# Synopsis

~~~
bash$ gridlabd GLMFILE --loadshape[=CSVFILE] [*|SCHEDULENAME[,...]]
~~~

# Description

The `--loadshape` option generates a CSV table containing the loadshape data generated by the schedules found in the model. 

If CSVFILE is given, the output will be generated to that file. Otherwise the data is output to /dev/stdout.  

If one or more SCHEDULENAME values are given, only those schedules will be used to generate the loadshape data.  If `--loadshape` is the last option given and no schedules are specified, then all the schedules are output.  Use the `*` option to output all schedules when `--loadshape` is not the last option.

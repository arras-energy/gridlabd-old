[[/Global/Gridlabd]] -- Simulate macro

# Synopsis

~~~
#gridlabd <options>
~~~

# Description

The `#gridlabd` macro is similar to the `#exec gridlabd <options>` macro, except that it ensures the simulation it runs is exactly the same version as the caller.  Unlike `#exec gridlabd <options>`, this macro ignores the `PATH` environment variable.

[[/GLM/Macro/Subcommand]] -- Subcommand macros

# Synopsis

GLM:

~~~
#<subcommand> <options> ...
~~~

# Description

All subcommands can be executed by passing through the macro interpreter.  The general syntax takes the macro and prepends `gridlabd-` before calling the subcommand script installed in `/usr/local/share/gridlabd`.

The stdout stream is piped to the GridLAB-D output stream and stderr is piped to the GridLAB-D error stream.

# Example

~~~
#aws s3 ls

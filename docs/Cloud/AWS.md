# Description

To access AWS resources, you must have a valid AWS account and obtain an access token with which to configure your local agent.  See the [Secret credentials Tab](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?section=security_credentials) of the [AWS IAM User page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?section=security_credentials).

Once have you obtained your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, you must run the `aws configure` command to give your local agent access:
~~~
user@localhost$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: *******
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: *******
Default region name [None]:
Default output format [None]:
~~~

Current GridLAB-D is designed to support EC2 and S3 resources only.

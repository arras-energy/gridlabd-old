The following server command is supported in this version of GridLAB-D:
~~~~
host% curl http://<hostname>:<portnum>/read/<object-name>.<property-name>;...
~~~~
where the semicolon separated tuple `<object-name>.<property-name>` may be repeated for multiple properties up to the length of a HTTP GET method request (which is  1024 characters in GridLAB-D).

The return value is a JSON list of the form
~~~~
[
    {"object" : "<object-name>", "property" : "<property-name>", "value" : "<property-value>"},
    ...
    ]
~~~~
with one tuple for each entry of the GET request.

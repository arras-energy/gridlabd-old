"master" -> [Build] -> gridlabd/master:latest
"master" -> [Tag] -> gridlabd/master:[0-9]+
"master" -> [Tag] -> gridlabd/master:release-[0-9.]+

"master-{project}" -> [Build] -> gridlabd/{project}-master:latest
"master-{project}" -> [Tag] -> gridlabd/{project}-master:[0-9]+
"master-{project}" -> [Tag] -> gridlabd/{project}-master:release-[0-9.]+

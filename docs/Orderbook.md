[[Orderbook]] -- Implement real-time transactive market mechanism

The [[orderbook]] Transactive Energy system is based on a true real-time market using a continuous order book instead of a periodic auction.  In an order book, two lists of limit orders are maintained and market orders are accepted and cleared in real-time.

Limit orders are used to inform the market of the availability of a resource to supply (sell) or consumer (buy) a specified quantity of service at a specified price for a specified duration.  

Market orders are used to obtain from the market an immediate commitment of supply resource (buy) or demand (sell) at the best price possible at the present time.

[[dump]] -- Dump request directive

# Synopsis
GLM:
~~~
  dump interval filename;
~~~

# Description
The [[dump]] directive causes the dump file `filename` to be generated at the `interval` times. 

If the filename starts with a dash, then the output is sent to stdout in `GLM` format.  Adding the extension after the dash causes the specified format to use generated (i.e., `glm`, `xml`, or `json`).

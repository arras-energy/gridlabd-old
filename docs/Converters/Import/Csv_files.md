# Description

There are many different types of CSV files that can be imported. Each is documented separately according to the type of data it delivers to the GLM loader.

## External data

External data can be converted to either player files or calibrated GLM objects. Each converter has options that determine whether the resulting GLM model is a raw data played in using a [[/Module/Tape/Player]] object or calibrated physics-based models using the appropriate module, e.g., [[/Module/Residential/House]] object.

## GLM models

GLM models can have data defined in CSV file imports as GLM, either as a set of [[/GLM/Macro/Define]] statements (a configuration), a set of [[/GLM/Directive/Modify]] statements.  In addition, some templates have converters defined to prepare input data, e.g., integration capacity analysis.

## Weather data

Weather data can be obtained from many different sources.  The converters current support NOAA, Onpoint, and Visual Crossing weather data downloads.

# Manual GridLAB-D Installation on Mac OS X

## Catalina

Coming soon...

## Mojave

To manually build GridLAB-D under Mojave you will need to install `git` if it
is not already installed. Then do the following

~~~
bash$ brew update || ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HomeBrew/install/master/install)"
bash$ brew doctor
bash$ brew install autoconf automake libtool gnu-sed python3
bash$ pip3 install numpy pandas matplolib
bash$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/gsed /usr/local/bin/sed
bash$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
bash$ git clone https://github.com/dchassin/gridlabd gridlabd
bash$ cd gridlabd
bash$ autoreconf -isf
bash$ ./configure
bash$ make -j30 install
bash$ gridlabd --version
~~~

The last command should display something like
~~~
GridLAB-D 4.2.0-191010
~~~

At this point it is recommended that you validation your installation with the following command
~~~
bash$ gridlabd --validate
~~~
This process can take several minutes.

## Older versions of Mac OS Z

If building using the method for the current release of Mac OS X doesn't work, 
try following these instructions for older releases of OS X.

You must have `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`, and `python3` installed to build 
GridLAB-D manually. With newer versions of the OS X, you will also need 
`gnu-sed` and have it symlinked to `sed`.  To install the necessary tools, we 
recommend using XCode and homebrew.

1. Install XCode

In the `XCode` menu, select `Preferences`.  Select the `Downloads` tab.  Select 
`Command Line Tools` and `install`.

2. Install `homebrew`
      % sudo ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
      % sudo brew doctor

3. Install `autoconf`, `automake`, and `libtool`
      % sudo brew install autoconf
      % sudo brew install automake
      % sudo brew install libtool

The above commands should create symlinks in `/usr/local/bin` to each of these
tools.  On some combinations of XCode version and Mac OSX version, the
symlinks don't get created.  If this is the case, create them with
      % sudo brew ln --force autoconf
      % sudo brew ln --force automake
      % sudo brew ln --force libtool

4. Install `gnu-sed`
      % sudo brew install gnu-sed

Then symlink `gsed` to `sed`
      % sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/gsed /usr/local/bin/sed

Make sure symlinked `sed` is the first instance of sed in the path
      % which sed

If `/usr/local/bin/sed` is not the response, put `/usr/local/bin` first in the path
you can do this temporarily using:
      % export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
or permanently by editing the file `/etc/paths`

5. Download the source code

If you are building from a source distribution you must first run:

      % git clone https://github.com/<user>/<repo> gridlabd
      % cd gridlabd
      % autoreconf -isf
      % ./configure

If you get a warning about Xerces-C, you will need to build and install Xerces-C:

      % (cd third_party; source install_xercesc)
      % ./configure

Once everything is setup you can build and install `gridlabd`:
      % make -j20 install

You can test your installation by using the `--validate` option:
      % gridlabd --validate
      
Whenever changes have been made to `configure.ac` or any of the `makefile.am`
files, the following build steps must be executed from the source-path folder:  
      % autoreconf -isf
      % ./configure
      % make -j20 install

Make should detect changes to `configure.ac` and `makefile.am` files and
automatically rerun the first two commands as needed.  If files are added to a module,
add the filename to `makefile.am` in that module's directory and remake. If `make`
does not automatically perform the required steps, rerun `autoreconf -isf` and
`./configure` manually.

If you checkout a branch that has different files, you may have to clean the files
to match a new distribution first:
      % make distclean -i
      % autoreconf -isf
      % ./configure
      % make -j20 install

To distribute the source code, it is best to fork the project and begin work from
your own GitHub repository.

On some Mac OS X systems, the GNU libtools are prefixed with a 'g' to differentiate them
from the NeXTStep libtool.  Before performing the steps above, you may have to tell the
autotool set where to find `libtool` and `libtoolize` by setting the LIBTOOL and
LIBTOOLIZE environment variables.  The following lines are an example:

    % export LIBTOOL=/usr/bin/glibtool
    % export LIBTOOLIZE=/usr/bin/glibtoolize
    % autoreconf -isf
 
For information on the sample models, see `models/README.md`.

On some very old version of Mac OS X you may run into a problem with `rpl_malloc` being undefined
during the build.  If so, set the following environment before running `./configure`
    % export ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes

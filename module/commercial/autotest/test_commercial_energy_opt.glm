// validates commercial office energy usage calculation; 25kW, 50kW of lights and an HVAC
// system in a constant AUX state are all run for 6s
// initial air temperature set to 90degF,with heating/cooling setpoints set to 70/73 
// with a .1degF deadband lights added to supply internal heating gains occupancy set 
// to 1 for all hours of all seven days of the week OCCUPANCY IS BASED ON OLD SCHEDULING 
// SYSTEM (which doesn't take in the correct input) MAY NEED TO BE UPDATED ONCE THE SWITCH 
// TO THE NEW SCHEDULING SYSTEM IS MADE; BASED ON OUTSIDE OFFICE TEMP OF 59degF

## Projects

SLAC has a number of active projects making contributions to the SLAC version of GridLAB-D.  Projects are encouraged to use the `master` branch. Project may use a sub-master branch named `project-master`, which can be used to consolidate PRs from multiple project-specific branches.

## Issues

New issues, bug reports, and enhancement requests should be filed using the [issue request template](issue_template.md).  Note that issues may not be picked up right away unless they are assigned to a project.

## Pull Request

A draft pull request should be opened as soon as work on the branch begins.  Please use the [pull request template](pull_request_template.md) to document your request. All discussion regarding the branch must be recorded on the PR, rather than on the issue.  

_Note_: When a merge is performed, the PR is automatically closed and the branch is deleted. The original issue(s) should also be closed when the merge is performed.  However, if the issue is not fully resolved, or if the PR has unresolved problems or questions, then new issues should be created to address each unresolved issue in the PR.

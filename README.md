## Important Note

This repository is SLAC National Accelerator's version of HiPAS GridLAB-D.  Only SLAC projects may contribute to this repository.  Changes made in this repository will be migrated back to the [original GridLAB-D repository](https://github.com/gridlab-d/gridlab-d) at PNNL's discretion.

# User quick start

The preferred method of using SLAC releases of GridLAB-D is to download the SLAC master image from docker hub (see https://cloud.docker.com/u/gridlabd/repository/docker/gridlabd/slac-master).  You must install the docker daemon to use docker images.  See https://www.docker.com/get-started for details.

Once you have installed docker, you may issue the following commands to run GridLAB-D at the command line:
~~~
  host% docker run -it -v $PWD:/model gridlabd/slac-master gridlabd -W /model [load-options] [filename.glm] [run-options] 
~~~ 
On many systems, an alias can be used to make this a simple command that resemble the command you would normally issue to run a host-based installation:
~~~
  host% alias gridlabd='docker run -it -v $PWD:/model gridlabd/slac-master gridlabd -W /model'
~~~
Note that this alias will interfere with the host-based installation.

# Developer quick start

*Note*: This fork of [GridLAB-D](https://github.com/gridlab-d/gridlab-d) does not support MS Windows directly. You must use docker or a virtual machine running linux.

Normally on Linux and Mac OS X developers you should use the `install.sh` script to setup the system, perform the initial build, and install GridLAB-D for all users on the system. 
~~~
host% git clone https://github.com/slacgismo/gridlabd gridlabd
host% gridlabd/install.sh
~~~

The `gridlabd` command is added to the `/usr/local/bin` folder, so this folder must be included in the path for all users, e.g., as specified in `/etc/profile` or `/etc/profile.d`.

You may work with a user installation instead of a system installation. Assuming your development system is ready (see https://github.com/slacgismo/gridlabd/wiki/Install#mac-osx-and-linux for details), you can "quickly" download and build a host-based installation from a branch using the following commands:

~~~
  host% git clone https://github.com/slacgismo/gridlabd -b _branch-name_ _work-folder_
  host% cd _work-folder_
  host% autoreconf -isf
  host% ./configure --enable-silent-rules --prefix=$PWD/install [_options_]
  host% make -j install
  host% export PATH=$PWD/install/bin:$PATH
  host% gridlabd --version
  host% gridlabd --validate
~~~

## Useful configure options
 - `--with-mysql=/usr/local` to enable support for mysql (assuming you install mysql-dev on your system)
 - `CXXFLAGS='-w -O0 -g'` to enable debugging of C++ source code (e.g., module code)
 - `CFLAGS='-w -O0 -g'` to enable debugging of C source code (e.g., core code)

## Notes
- The version number should contain the _branch-name_.  If not, use the `which gridlabd` command to check that the path is correct.
- You can control whether your local version run the docker image instead of the local install using the `--docker` command-line option.
- In theory all validate tests of the master should pass. However, sometimes issues arise that aren't caught until after a merge into master.  If you encounter a validation error, please check the issues to see if it has not already been reported.  When reporting such a problem, please include the `--origin` command line option output, the `validate.txt` output, and the output from `uname -a` to assist in reproducing and diagnosing the problem.

## Pro tip

If you accumulate a lot of local branches that no longer exist on the remote repo, you can use the following command to purge them:

~~~
host% git fetch -p && git branch -vv | awk '/: gone]/{print $1}' | xargs git branch -D
~~~

## Citation

If you use this fork of GridLAB-D for a publication you are required to cite it, e.g.,

Chassin, D.P., et al., "GridLAB-D Version _major_._minor_._patch_-_build_ (_branch_) _platform_", (_year_) [online]. Available at _url_, Accessed on: _month_ _day_, _year_.

You may use the `--cite` command option to obtain the correct citation for your version:
~~~
host% gridlabd --cite
Chassin, D.P., et al. "GridLAB-D 4.2.0-191008 (fix_python_validate) DARWIN", (2019) [online]. Available at https://github.com/slacgismo/gridlabd/commit/dfc392dc0208419ce9be0706f699fdd9a11e3f5b, Accessed on: Oct. 8, 2019.
~~~
This will allow anyone to identify the exact version you are using to obtain it from GitHub.
